        "Training reinforcement learning policies in simulation allows parallelization and scale that far surpasses that of using real world training data since simulations can be run on demand, limited only by the available compute. However, training successful reinforcement learning policies requires simulations to have highly accurate contact and rigid body dynamics or else learned models won't transfer to reality, and also requires efficient calculations in simulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prior to MuJoCo, no simulator really suited the needs of robotics simulation training for these reasons. MuJoCo (Multi-Joint Dynamics with Contact) introduced a fast, parallelizable, and accurate simulation system with suitable accuracy for robotics training. It was introduced as open source software, and has been used for most robotics simulation training since.\n",

        "Current physics engines aren’t fast enough for controller design. Tools that are used for controller design don’t have physics simulation capabilities.\n",

        "They suggest that the absence of good simulation tools to design controllers may be one reason modern robots perform poorly.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "This increase comes from better compute utilization, parallelization, and higher accuracy/stability allowing large time steps per calculation.\n",

        "If the physics engine allows cheating, the controller will exploit this cheat. So the engine has to be accurate.\n",
