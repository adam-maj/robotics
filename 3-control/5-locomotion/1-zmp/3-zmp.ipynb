        "The primary challenge in biped locomotion is in:\n",
        "1. Keeping the robot balanced while the position, orientation, and number of ground contacts are constantly shifting\n",
        "2. Effectively manipulating the ground contacts to move the robot to the intended destination\n",
        "\n",
        "For a robot with two legs, we can accomplish the first goal by understanding the subset of the robot joint configuration space that orients the feet and the entire robot above the feet such that the robot is balanced. We can think of this as imposing a constraint on the total set of possible configurations for the robot.\n",
        "\n",
        "To maintain balance, we need one foot to always remain in contact with the ground. In order to accomplish this, the robot should be configured so that the total force and torque on the foot doesn't result in a rotation in any direction (which would cause the foot to lose contact with the ground and fall over).\n",
        "\n",
        "This means that the force and torque on the robot foot coming from the weight and movement of the rest of the robot above it needs to balance the counteracting force of the ground pushing up on the robot foot with respect to a point on the robot foot. This point is known as the **zero moment point** (ZMP). \n",
        "\n",
        "If the point where the forces would all cancel each other out falls outside of the robot foot, there will be a net moment on the robot, calling it to fall. This framing is useful, because we can then accomplish the goal of robotic balancing by trying to ensure that no action taken by the robot will ever result in the ZMP falling outside of the robot foot."

        "The basic characteristics of all biped locomotion systems:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The entire system can rotate around a single foot due to an outside disturbance (which can shift the system off balance)\n",
        "- Achieving gait repeatability (consistently applying the same walking patterns)\n",
        "- Regular interchange between single and double foot phases (one foot supporting vs. two feet supporting). Locomotion changes from an open to closed chain as these switch.\n",
        "\n",
        "The foot contact is essential. The position of the robot with respect to the environment is determined by the position of the feet with respect to the ground.\n",
        "\n",
        "> The foot cannot be controlled directly but in an indirect way, by ensuring the appropriate dynamics of the mechanism above the foot. Thus, the overall indicator of the mechanism behavior is the point where the influence of all forces acting on the mechanism can be replaced by one single force.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Recognition of the significance and role of ZMP in the biped artificial walk was a turning point in gait planning and control.\n",
        "\n",
        "> The aim of this work is primarily to remind the reader of the seminal results related to ZMP.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The ZMP Notion\n",
        "\n",
        "> Apart from the realization of the relative motion of the mechanism’s links, the most important task of a locomotion mechanism during the gait is to preserve its dynamic balance (some “new” authors use the term “stability”), which is achieved by ensuring the foot’s whole area, and not only the edge, is in contact with the ground.\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of the locomotion is [1] to move the robot and [2] to maintain balance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Balance can be defined by keeping the full robot foot in contact with the ground.\n",

        "\n",
        "For locomotion, we are only concerned with the forces acting on the robots foot. The forces come from the force/moment exerted on the foot by the above robot and the force/moment exerted on the foot by the ground pushing up on the foot + friction.\n",
        "\n",
        "The friction forces $F_x$ and $F_y$ balance the horizontal force components on the foot, and the upward force $F_z$ balances the vertical moment and force from the robot.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the ground can only act directly up on the foot, the ground reaction force will have to shift horizontally on the foot in order to counteract the horizontal moment on the ankle.\n",
        "\n",
        "> The moment $M_{A_X}$ is balanced by shifting the acting point of the force $R_z$, whose intensity is determined by the equation of balance of all the forces acting on the foot, by the corresponding distance $y$.\n",
        "\n",
        "An ankle moment can only be compensated by changing the position of the ground reaction force.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the ankle moment can’t be compensated by the ground reaction force because the point to compensate the moment is outside the foot, then the robot will rotate around the ankle and can fall. The task of balancing the robot is about maintaining this constraint.\n",
        "\n",
        "This equilibrium requires that the $M_x = 0$ and $M_y = 0$ on the foot, hence it is known as the **zero-moment point**.\n",
        "\n",
        "We have an equation for calculating the ground reaction point of the robot based on the following:\n",

        "\n",
        "Equation 2 requires that the robot foot doesn’t move vertically (the ground reaction force up balances the force of the robot and gravity down)\n",
        "\n",
        "Equation 3 requires that the moment caused by the ground reaction force balances out the moments caused by gravity and by the moment/force caused by the robot on the foot.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then they get an equation which gives the position of the ground reaction force acting point $P$.\n",

        "Then they need to use this to calculate whether the system is in dynamic equilibrium.\n",
        "\n",
        "The ZMP check is then: in order for the system to be in dynamic equilibrium, a point P that satisfies equation 4 must be within the polygon on of the robot foot.\n",
        "\n",
        "In operating a robot, ZMP plays a role in [1] determining the dynamics of the mechanism above the foot to ensure a valid ZMP position [2] determining the ZMP position for the mechanism in motion.\n",
        "\n",
        "Case 1 is called gait synthesis. Case 2 is called gait control.\n",
        "\n",
        "They can use ground sensors to measure the current ZMP of the robot.\n",
        "\n",
        "We calculate the ZMP. If it’s inside the polygon, the robot is balanced, otherwise it’s not.\n",
        "\n",
        "> The ZMP concept has been properly comprehended by researchers, widely used, and very frequently cited. It can be noted that, although being essentially correct, all the ZMP definitions differ significantly in the extent of their detail.\n",
        "\n",
        "> ZMP is defined as that point on the ground at which the net moment of the inertial forces and the gravity forces has no component along the horizontal axes.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is an important difference between the ZMP and the center of pressure (CoP). The CoP is the place where the ground acts on the foot. In dynamic balance, the ZMP and the CoP are the same. In states where the system isn’t balanced, the ZMP doesn’t exist whereas the CoP does.\n",
        "\n",
        "The FZMP is the hypothetical ZMP that would balance the robot (outside the polygon of the foot).\n",
        "\n",

        "Humanoids may become slightly more complex to become more general purpose in the human world with softer/multi-link feet, elastic joints, transitions between walking patterns, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "The ground usually means something immobile, but the robot also needs to be able to walk on something deformable/mobile as well. The supports shouldn’t be considered static but should be considered dynamic systems.\n",
