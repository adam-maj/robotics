    "> Our algorithm was faster than the alternatives, solved more problems, and yielded higher quality paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best trajectory optimization problem that consider smoothness and collision avoidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Trajectory optimization algorithms have two roles in robotic motion planning. First, they can be used to smooth and shorten trajectories generated by some other method. Second, they can be used to plan from scratch: one initializes with a trajectory that contains collisions and perhaps violates constraints, and one hopes that the optimization converges to a high-quality trajectory satisfying constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2 important elements of an optimization algorithm are [1] the numerical optimization method and [2] the method for checking for and penalizing collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "TrajOpt breaks down the cost function into a series of convex (quadratic) optimization problems that approximate the true cost function, allowing the model to train more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their algorithm is very fast, which is enabled by their formulation of the collision penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their method is also more reliable, able to solve many path planning problems that take a long time for other methods to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their algorithm is also better for path quality, converging to locally optimal solutions for avoiding obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their approach is also flexible - it can easily update to adding new costs and obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Overall, our algorithm was not only faster than the alternatives, but it solved a larger fraction of the problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "> Sequential convex optimization solves a non-convex optimization problem by repeatedly constructing a convex subproblem - an approximation to the problem around the current iterate $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequential convex needs a method to make the step size small and a strategy to turn infeasible constraints into penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motion Planning Benchmark\n",
    "\n",
    "> We tested both our algorithm and CHOMP under two conditions: single initialization and multiple initializations. For the single initialization, we used a straight line in configuration space from the start to the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our algorithm with multiple initializations substantially outperformed the other approaches in both sets of problems.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "> Using this approach, we plan a sequence of steps across a room, as shown in figure 7. Each step is planned separately using the phases described above. The robot is able to obey these stability and footstep placement constraints while ducking under an obstacle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "> One of the main challenges in taking motion planning from simulation to reality is creating a useful representation of the environment’s geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The point clouds we used were obtained by mapping out the environment using SLAM and then preprocessing the map to obtain a convex decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "> While the motivation of this work is similar to CHOMP, our approach differs from CHOMP in several important dimensions, most notably that (1) we use a different approach for collision detection, and (2) we use a different numerical optimization scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Spheres and distance fields are arguably not very well suited to situations where one needs to accurately model geometry, which is why collision-detection methods based on meshes and convex primitives are more prevalent in applications like realtime physics simulation, which require speed and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Another advantage of sequential quadratic programming is that it can handle deeply infeasible initializations using penalties and merit functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "> We presented a novel algorithm that uses trajectory optimization for robotic motion planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our algorithm was faster than the alternatives, solved a larger fraction of problems, and produced better paths."
