    "> In domains sparsely populated by obstacles, the heuristics used by sampling-based planners to navigate “narrow passages” can be needlessly complex; furthermore, additional post-processing is required to remove the jerky or extraneous motions from the paths that such planners generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In recent years, sampling-based planning algorithms have met with widespread success due to their ability to rapidly discover the connectivity of high-dimensional configuration spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "PRM and RRT are often deployed in 2 phase: [1] first find a feasible path [2] optimize the path to remove jerky motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortest paths are found by slicing paths into shorter parts, and gradient based methods are used to find minimum-energy paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "CHOMP is an algorithm for improving paths that can start with a naive path that has collisions and improve it from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Instead of merely finding feasible paths, our goal is to directly construct trajectories which optimize over a variety of dynamic and task-based criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The CHOMP Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "> In this section, we present CHOMP, a new trajectory optimization procedure based on covariant gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "They use geometrical relations to: [1] encourage smoothness by measuring update size in terms of changes of a dynamical quality to the path [2] measurements of obstacle costs should be taken in the environment to respect real geometries [3] trajectory update considerations should also be used to update from joint limit violations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Covariant Gradient Descent**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to find a smooth collision-free trajectory through configuration space from start to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trajectory cost is measured by dynamical terms and the cost of being near obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariant gradient descent encodes knowledge about the environments gradient into the vector so gradient descent is aware of the geometries.\n",
    "\n",
    "They perform updates after each step of the trajectory that ensure that the trajectory is smooth.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Understanding the update rule**\n",
    "\n",
    "> CHOMP is covariant in the sense that the change to the trajectory that results from the update is a function only of the trajectory itself, and not the particular representation used - at least in the limit of small step size and fine discretization.\n",
    "\n",
    "> When applying CHOMP, we typically use a simplified geometric description of our robots, approximating the robot as a “skeleton” of spheres and capsules, or line-segment swept spheres.\n",
    "\n",
    "> However, there is an important difference that substantially improves performance in practice. Rather than integrating with respect to arc-length through configuration space, we integrate with respect to arc-length in the workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This simple modification represents a fundamental change: instead of assuming the geometry in the configuration space is Euclidean, we compute geometrical quantities directly in the workspace where Euclidean assumptions are more natural.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Joint limits are traditionally handled by either adding a new potential to the objective function which penalizes the trajectory for approaching the limits, or by performing a simple projection back onto the set of feasible joint values when a violation of the limits is detected. In our experiments, we follow the latter approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "CHOMP computes trajectories as linked waypoints. It uses the gradient to optimize the waypoints toward smoothness and away from obstacles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiments on a robotic arm\n",
    "\n",
    "> Surprisingly, when CHOMP successfully finds a collision free trajectory, straight-line initialization typically outperforms RRT initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our approach to robotic legged locomotion decomposes the problem into a footstep planner which informs the robot where to place its feet as it traverses the terrain [6], and a footstep controller which generates full-body trajectories to realize the planned footsteps.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what the split looks like in an actual motion planning scenario for a quadruped.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Footsteps for the LittleDog robot consist of a stance phase, where all four feet have ground contact, and a swing phase, where the swing leg is moved to the next support location.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For a given footstep, we run CHOMP as coordinate descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The initial trunk trajectory is given by a Zero Moment Point (ZMP) preview controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "They add priors to penalize collisions and kinematic reachability errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Unlike many of the other teams who seemed to focus on feedback control, operational control, and other reactive behaviors, our strategy has been to strongly leverage optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "> This work presents a powerful new trajectory optimization procedure that solves a much wider range of problems than previous optimizers, including many to which randomized planners are traditionally applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Finally, this algorithm is amenable to new machine learning techniques.\n"
